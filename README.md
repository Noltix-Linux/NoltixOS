#                               NoltixOS: An <a href="https://awesomewm.org/">awesome</a> distribution!

NoltixOS is an GNU/Linux distro that is based off Arch and it's goal is to make Arch Linux accesible to more people.

It uses ALCI's config for the Calamares Installer and comes with dwm in the live session, and AwesomeWM & SDDM after the installation.

Notice: If you try to manually build the iso with mkarchiso, you may come across the fact it doesnt have the calamares installer, well to fix that just add ALCI's config for calamares (https://github.com/arch-linux-calamares-installer/alci-calamares-config) In /airootfs/etc and then you're pretty much done.


# Feautures
* Fish shell preinstalled

    Fish is an modern, great and advanced shell for Linux, macOS etc.


* Default WM is AwesomeWM

    Awesome window manager is an advanced Window manager based off dwm. It is written in C and Lua. You can also install themes for the WM to personalize it.


* Graphical Installer
   
     You may already know this but NoltixOS uses the Calamares Installer to quickly get the OS setup.

* SDDM built-in

   SDDM is an great display manager for Linux. It is the one that NoltixOS normally comes with.
